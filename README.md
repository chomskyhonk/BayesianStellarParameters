# BayesianStellarParameters
Bayesian inference pipeline to estimate fundamental stellar parameters, specifically age and metallicity, for Solar neighbourhood stars. Traditional frequentist techniques from suffer large uncertainties and isochrone degeneracies. This project tests whether a Bayesian framework can improve inference and reproduce known Galactic trends.
