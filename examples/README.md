# Examples

This directory contains example scripts and notebooks demonstrating how to use the code.

## Contents

Add example files such as:
- **Tutorial notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks walking through the analysis pipeline
- **Example scripts**: Standalone scripts showing specific use cases
- **Sample data**: Small datasets for testing and demonstration
- **Output examples**: Example plots and results

## Usage

Each example should be self-contained and include:
- Clear description of what it demonstrates
- Required input data (or instructions to obtain it)
- Expected output
- Estimated runtime

## Getting Started

Start with the basic examples and progress to more advanced use cases:
1. `example_01_basic_analysis.py` - Basic stellar parameter inference
2. `example_02_visualization.py` - Visualizing results
3. `example_03_advanced.py` - Advanced features and customization
